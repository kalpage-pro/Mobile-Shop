***************************
APPLICATION FAILED TO START
***************************

Description:

The dependencies of some of the beans in the application context form a cycle:

┌─────┐
|  securityConfig (field private com.wiley.laptopstore.service.CustomUserDetailsService com.wiley.laptopstore.config.SecurityConfig.customUserDetailsService)
↑     ↓
|  customUserDetailsService (field private org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder com.wiley.laptopstore.service.CustomUserDetailsService.passwordEncoder)
└─────┘


Action:

Relying upon circular references is discouraged and they are prohibited by default. Update your application to remove the dependency cycle between beans. As a last resort, it may be possible to break the cycle automatically by setting spring.main.allow-circular-references to true.
